Problem Statement:
5.2 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. 
If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. 
Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.


Solution:
largest = 0
smallest = None
while True:
    name = input("Enter the name:")
    if name == 'done':
        break
    try:
        num = int(name)
        if largest < num:
			largest = num
        if smallest > num or smallest is None:
			smallest = num
    except:
        print("Invalid input")
            
print("Maximum is", largest)
print("Minimum is", smallest)
